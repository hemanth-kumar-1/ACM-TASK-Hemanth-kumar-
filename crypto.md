# Crypto challenges
## Basic xor
Here ct = 1017161a133a4207375c0b1c01371c0d07120015

Here we can use cyberchef platform to decede the hexadecimal cipher text.

first we use HEX and XOR in the format.

in xor we use the key = recr{

Then we will get bruhh as the first five letters of the decrypt message.

Then we will use bruhh as key and we will xor.

password = recr{X0r_4int_tough}

## BASED
Here the cipher text is decoded from sveral bases.

first the cipher is decoded from base 32,base 58, base 32, base 64.

password = recr{Demn_You_just_reached_the_fourth_base_XD}

## Crptohack
Beginer course

1 st flag is given by them.

for second flag: we should run a code where he is xoring list of number with 50 in decimal.

flag = crypto{z3n_0f_pyth0n}

third: if we convert the given decimal values to ascii values we obtain key.(by python prog)

flag = crypto{ASCII_pr1nt4bl3}

fourth: given a hexadecimal code convert into decimal then to ascii.(by python prog)

flag = crypto{You_will_be_working_with_hex_strings_a_lot}

fifth: first convert it into bytes and then encode to hex(by python prog)

flag = crypto/Base+64+Encoding+is+Web+Safe/

sixth: convert it into hexadecimal and then to binary then to ascii(by python prog)

flag = crypto{3nc0d1n6_4ll_7h3_w4y_d0wn}

seven: first convert the char into decimal value then xor it with 13, convert it again into char.(by python prog)

flag = crypto{aloha}
