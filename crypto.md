# Crypto challenges
## Basic xor
Here ct = 1017161a133a4207375c0b1c01371c0d07120015

Here we can use cyberchef platform to decede the hexadecimal cipher text.

first we use HEX and XOR in the format.

in xor we use the key = recr{

Then we will get bruhh as the first five letters of the decrypt message.

Then we will use bruhh as key and we will xor.

password = recr{X0r_4int_tough}

## BASED
Here the cipher text is decoded from sveral bases.

first the cipher is decoded from base 32,base 58, base 32, base 64.

password = recr{Demn_You_just_reached_the_fourth_base_XD}
